You're among the first 50 people to see this.

I've been working on something that I think will fundamentally change how manufacturing shops quote jobs.

Here's the problem we all know too well:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       4.5 HOURS
   Average time to quote a single part
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

That's HOURS of reading drawings, extracting dimensions, looking up materials, building BOMs, calculating labor times...

And by the time you quote? Someone else already won the job.

What if you could do it in under 60 seconds?

I've built an AI apprentice called Esti that:

• Reads any 2D drawing (PDF, image — no CAD needed)
• Extracts materials, dimensions, GD&T callouts, and specs
• Generates a complete MBOM in seconds
• Builds intelligent process routing
• Calculates costs with tolerance-based multipliers
• Verifies every item back to the source drawing

No more spreadsheets. No more guesswork. Just upload and quote.

### Body (simplified for quick send):

```
Hey [Name],

I've been building something I think you'll find interesting.

You know how quoting takes 4-5 hours per job? Reading drawings, extracting dimensions, looking up materials, building BOMs...

What if it took 60 seconds?

I built an AI that reads engineering drawings and generates quotes automatically. It's called Esti.

Here's a quick demo I put together:
👉 https://esti-reveal-hqmllgsvd-vcnairs-projects.vercel.app/

And if you want to try it yourself:
👉 https://esti-plum.vercel.app/

I'm only sharing this with people whose opinion I trust. Would love to hear what you think — just hit reply.

Varun

P.S. Takes about 3 minutes to go through the demo. Worth it.
